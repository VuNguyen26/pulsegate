## Latest Completed Sprint

Sprint 25 - Analytics Rollup Read Model Foundation

Status:

Done.

Sprint 25 added a safe read-only analytics rollup read model:

- Added analytics rollup read query parsing and validation.
- Added usage rollup read repository.
- Added rejected rollup read repository.
- Added analytics rollup read service.
- Added GET /internal/admin/analytics/rollups.
- Added admin API key protection for the rollup read endpoint.
- Added source-specific filter validation for usage and rejected rollups.
- Added Docker runtime validation for the endpoint.
- Preserved successful usage and rejected/security event separation.
- Preserved gateway.api_usage_events as source of truth for successful usage and quota counting.
- Preserved gateway.api_rejected_events as source of truth for rejected/security traffic.
- Did not switch runtime summary APIs to rollup reads.
- Did not add retention deletion or scheduled/background jobs.
- Did not change quota checker, usage recorder, or rejected event recorder.

- 521 tests passed

Manual Docker/runtime validation:

- Docker Compose build and startup passed.
- API Gateway health returned 200.
- Missing admin API key for GET /internal/admin/analytics/rollups returned 401.

## Current Usage, Quota, Rejected Event, and Rollup Behavior

Usage event table:

- gateway.api_usage_events

Rejected event table:

- gateway.api_rejected_events

Rollup tables:

- gateway.api_usage_rollups
- gateway.api_rejected_rollups

Usage analytics:

- GET /internal/admin/usage/events returns raw successful usage event rows.
- Usage event listing supports filters, offset pagination, and cursor pagination with nextCursor.
- Consumer usage summary supports filters.
- API key usage summary supports filters.
- Invalid usage analytics query returns 400 INVALID_QUERY_PARAMETER.
- Runtime usage summaries still read gateway.api_usage_events.

Rejected event observability:

- GET /internal/admin/api-rejections/summary returns aggregate rejected traffic totals.
- GET /internal/admin/api-rejections/events returns raw rejected event rows.
- Rejected event APIs support filters and raw listing cursor pagination.
- Runtime rejected analytics still read gateway.api_rejected_events.

Analytics rollup read model:

- GET /internal/admin/analytics/rollups returns read-only rollup rows.
- source is required and must be usage or rejected.
- granularity is required and must be hour or day.
- from and to are required ISO timestamps.
- Usage rollup read supports cacheStatus.
- Rejected rollup read supports rejectionReason.
- statusCode maps to statusClass for usage rollups and exact statusCode for rejected rollups.
- Invalid rollup read query returns 400 INVALID_QUERY_PARAMETER.

Current quota scope:

- DB-backed API keys only.
- API key must have usagePlanId.
- Usage plan must be enabled.
- Quota windows are DAILY or MONTHLY.
- Quota uses gateway.api_usage_events as source of truth.
- Rejected requests are tracked in gateway.api_rejected_events.
- Rejected requests are intentionally not stored in gateway.api_usage_events.
- Rollup tables are not used for quota counting.

---

## Current Limitations

- Usage summary APIs still read raw events.
- Rejected summary APIs still read raw events.
- Rollup read endpoint exists, but summary APIs have not switched to rollup reads.
- No retention policy job yet.
- No scheduled/background rollup job yet.
- No per-consumer Grafana dashboard yet.
- No per-key Grafana dashboard yet.
- No quota/rejected-events Grafana dashboard yet.
- Disabled usage plans currently skip quota enforcement.
- Env fallback API keys are not quota-enforced.
- Admin Dashboard is not implemented yet.
- Developer Portal is not implemented yet.
- Admin auth is still local admin API key based.
- JWT auth is still local secret based.
- Dynamic router supports exact method + exact path matching only.
- Path parameters are not implemented yet.
- Wildcard upstream path forwarding is not implemented yet.
- Host-based routing is not implemented yet.
- Weighted upstreams are not implemented yet.
- Service discovery is not implemented yet.
- CI does not run the full Docker Compose runtime stack yet.
- CI does not push Docker images to a registry yet.
- CI does not deploy automatically yet.
- Kubernetes and cloud deployment are planned for later.

## Recommended Next Sprint

Sprint 26 recommended direction:

- Analytics Retention Safety Foundation

Recommended scope:

- Start with retention configuration and dry-run planning.
- Do not delete raw events in the first checkpoint.
- Keep successful usage and rejected/security events separate.
- Keep quota counting on gateway.api_usage_events.
- Avoid switching summary APIs to rollup reads unless explicitly selected.
- Avoid adding Kafka, RabbitMQ, Kubernetes, Admin Dashboard UI, Developer Portal UI, billing, paid plans, or multi-tenant organization model unless explicitly selected.

## Working Style

Continue using small stable checkpoints:

1. Implement one small checkpoint.
2. Explain changed files.
3. Run focused tests when useful.
4. Run npm run test.
5. Run npm run typecheck.
6. Run npm run build.
7. Run Docker validation when runtime behavior changes.
8. Commit only after stable validation.
9. Push after each stable commit.
10. Keep final docs compact.
