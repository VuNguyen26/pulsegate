## Current Usage, Quota, Rejection, and Analytics Foundation Behavior

Successful usage behavior:

- Successful downstream proxy/cache handler responses are recorded into gateway.api_usage_events.
- gateway.api_usage_events remains the source of truth for successful usage analytics and quota counting.
- Consumer and API key usage summaries support filters by time range, route, method, status code, cache status, and API key auth source.
- Raw successful usage events can be listed through GET /internal/admin/usage/events.
- Usage event listing supports offset pagination with limit, offset, total, and hasNextPage, plus cursor pagination with nextCursor.
- Usage event listing filters include from, to, routePath, routeMethod, statusCode, cacheStatus, apiKeyAuthSource, apiKeyId, and consumerId.

Rejected request behavior:

- Failed auth, rate-limited, and quota-denied requests are recorded into gateway.api_rejected_events.
- gateway.api_rejected_events remains the source of truth for rejected/security traffic observability.
- Rejected events can be queried through aggregate summary and raw listing endpoints with offset and cursor pagination.
- Raw API keys, JWTs, and Authorization headers are not stored or returned.

Analytics rollup behavior:

- Rollup persistence is separate for successful usage and rejected/security traffic.
- Rollup upserts use a dimensionHash to avoid nullable-dimension uniqueness issues.
- Manual analytics rollup backfill is available through npm run analytics:rollup:backfill.
- GET /internal/admin/analytics/rollups exposes read-only usage or rejected rollup rows.
- Rollup read supports source, from, to, granularity, limit, and safe dimension filters.
- Current runtime summary and listing APIs still read raw event tables.
- Rollup tables are not used for quota counting.
- No retention deletion or scheduled/background rollup job is implemented yet.

Current analytics limitation:

- Usage and rejected summary APIs are still event-based at runtime.
- Rollup read endpoint exists, but summary APIs have not switched to rollup reads.
- No retention job is implemented yet.

## Useful Commands

Install dependencies:

    npm ci

Run automated validation:

    npm run test
    npm run typecheck
    npm run build
    git status

Start Docker stack:

    docker compose up --build -d
    docker compose ps

Deploy API Gateway migrations in Docker runtime:

    docker compose exec -T api-gateway npm run db:migrate:deploy --workspace api-gateway

Check API Gateway health:

    Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:3000/health | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

Stop Docker stack:

    docker compose down

## Recommended Next Sprint

Sprint 26 recommended direction:

- Analytics Retention Safety Foundation

Reason:

- Sprint 25 added a safe read-only rollup model and endpoint.
- The next backend step can start retention planning with dry-run safety while keeping quota counting on raw usage events.
